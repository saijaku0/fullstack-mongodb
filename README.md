### Create posts, view and comment, this is the slogan of this small pet project. ###

  The main technologies which I used for this pet-project, for database: MongooDB, NODE.JS, Express framework, for backend, also used Express-validation for validation forms, JWT to create a tokens. For folder structure and in all design project structure backend I chouse the MVC template

  Frontend will be base on React + TS framework, to connected backend and statemangment at application RTK, with createApi implementation. Folder structure I tried to adhere to the pattern FSD and reflect the understanding of this pattern of development 
  
### Important ###
I still create frontend for this app.


P. S. This project reflects nothing but the lonely path of the samurai.
